# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## Program
```
import math
class cse:
    def mech(self):
        a = int(input())
        c = math.pi * (a * a)
        print(f"Area of circle: {c:.2f}")
obj = cse()
obj.mech()

```

## Result
Thus,the Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius given by user and using class(cse) and method(mech) to perform a calculation is created successfully

## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

##  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

##  Program
```
def merge(d1, d2):
    return {**d1, **d2}
dict1 = eval(input())
dict2 = eval(input())
merged_dict = merge(dict1, dict2)
print(merged_dict)
```
## Output
<img width="1269" height="174" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 164951" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/796d5b62-0024-4463-990f-62ef7646959b" />

## Result
Thus,the python program that merges two dictionaries and combine ther key value pairs is executed successfully

# Dictionary-Python Program to Sort a Dictionary by Keys and Values

This Python program demonstrates how to sort a dictionary:
- Alphabetically by keys
- Alphabetically by values

---

## Aim

To write a Python program that sorts a dictionary's:
- Keys in alphabetical order
- Values in alphabetical order

---

##  Algorithm

1. **Start the program.**
2. **Define** a dictionary with key-value pairs.
3. **Sort by Keys**:
   - Use `sorted(dictionary.items())`
   - Convert the result to a dictionary using `dict()`
4. **Sort by Values**:
   - Use `sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])`
   - Convert the result to a dictionary using `dict()`
5. **Display** the original and sorted dictionaries.
6. **End the program.**

---

## 🧪Program
```
d={1:2,3:323,5:12,2:56,4:24,6:18}
sd=sorted(d.items(), key= lambda x : x[1])
print("Keys and Values sorted in alphabetical order by the value")
print(sd)
```

## Sample Output
<img width="1099" height="154" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 165839" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed8b24fa-1fae-4621-8e30-2583d1aea861" />

## Result
Thus, the python program that sorts a dictionary alphabetically by keys and values is created successfully

# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## Program
```
list1=[5, 10, 20]
msg="You're out of list range"
try:
    print(list1[5])


except IndexError:
    print(msg)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus,the Python program that handles an IndexError when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list is created successfully.

# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file `story.txt` that do **not** start with the alphabet `'T'`.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Open the file `story.txt` in **read mode**.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is **not** `'T'`.
   - If the line does not start with `'T'`, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the `count` value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with `'T'`.

## 🧾 Program
```
count = 0
with open("story.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if line[0] != 'T':
            count += 1
print(count)
```
## Output
<img width="1832" height="210" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-21 172615" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef5a637c-f250-49f1-b93e-e6f3bc8d9534" />

## Result
Thus,the Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file story.txt that do not start with the alphabet 'T' is executed successfully.
